# Steady Stream App - Component Integration Demo

## ✅ Integration Complete

I've successfully created and integrated Agent 2's components into the Steady Stream App. Here's what has been implemented:

### 🎯 Components Created

1. **ChatOverlay** (`src/components/ChatOverlay.tsx`)
   - Live chat interface with mock messages
   - Positioned on the right side of the screen
   - Interactive message sending functionality
   - Smooth animations and transitions

2. **BetSlipModal** (`src/components/BetSlipModal.tsx`)
   - Betting interface with mock bets
   - Stake adjustment functionality
   - Real-time calculation of potential returns
   - Centered modal with backdrop

3. **ProgramDetailsPopup** (`src/components/ProgramDetailsPopup.tsx`)
   - Program information display
   - Mock data for a Premier League match
   - Rating, cast, and description display
   - Action buttons for watching and favorites

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- **C** - Toggle Chat Overlay
- **B** - Toggle Bet Slip Modal
- **I** - Toggle Program Details Popup
- **ESC** - Close all overlays

### 🚀 Running the Demo

To run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Test Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Press 'C' to open/close the chat
   - Press 'B' to open/close the bet slip
   - Press 'I' to open/close program details
   - Press 'ESC' to close all overlays at once

2. **Test UI Controls**:
   - Click the buttons in the demo interface
   - Test the close buttons on each overlay
   - Verify that multiple overlays can be open simultaneously

3. **Test Component Functionality**:
   - Send a message in the chat
   - Adjust bet stakes in the bet slip
   - Check all interactive elements

### 🎨 Design Features

- Dark theme with gray-900/950 backgrounds
- Consistent color scheme across components
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Z-index management to prevent overlay conflicts

### 📋 Component Props

Each component accepts:
- `isOpen: boolean` - Controls visibility
- `onClose: () => void` - Callback for closing

### 🔄 State Management

- Independent state for each overlay
- Keyboard event handling with input field detection
- ESC key closes all overlays

### 🎭 Mock Data

All components include realistic mock data:
- Chat messages with timestamps
- Betting selections with odds
- Program details with full metadata

### 🚦 Next Steps

The components are ready for:
1. Integration with real data sources
2. Connection to WebSocket for live chat
3. API integration for betting functionality
4. Dynamic program data loading

### 🐛 Known Considerations

- Keyboard shortcuts are disabled when typing in input fields
- All overlays have proper z-index stacking
- Components are fully typed with TypeScript
